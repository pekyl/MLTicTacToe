# MLTicTacToe
Simple exercise on Reinforcement Learning for Tic-Tac-Toe game

## The idea of this exercise is to create a tic-tac-toe game to be played against the computer, where the computer uses reinforcement learning to “master” the game.
- The machine learns from its environment using rewards and errors
- Reinforcement learning is used to solve reward based problems
- No predefined data is used
- No supervision is required
- Follows a Trial and Error problem solving approach

## How does it work?
Just run main.py - it will first run training for the computer and then start the actual game that you can play. 
If you want to play again after first training, comment out the training section and run the game again to play against the previously trained model which is saved as policy_p1.
